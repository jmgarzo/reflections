How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see 
the bug that was introduced?

	In my opinion, it is imposible see a bug without the help of a tool like git.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make 
you a more efficient programmer in the long term? 

	Find bugs quicker.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to 
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions 
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	I think the developer has all the responsability.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving 
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each 
file separately?

	Because we use git making logical commits.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	We use the command git log to see all the changes and its title, then we use git 
	diff to compare two different commit


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes 
that could break something?
	
	We can find a fix more easyly the bug.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	I can not wait! I will use git for all my develop projects.
