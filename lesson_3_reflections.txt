When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	For example when we work with other person, and they upload a change. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	To control de changes, it is possible it creates conflicts 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	We only can use forks for github, but not in our local git repository.
	We can use branches to devide a branch, but in the same repository.
	We use clone to clone a repository(local repository or remote repository).
