When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	For example when we work with other person, and they upload a change. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	To control de changes, it is possible it creates conflicts 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	We only can use forks for github, but not in our local git repository.
	We can use branches to devide a branch, but in the same repository.
	We use clone to clone a repository(local repository or remote repository). 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	You work with a update code, and you avoid conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	I would collaborate using SVN or others tools.
	I think, with SVN, it would be harder make forks, or work without internet connection.
	It would be easier nothing.

	Commands:

	git pull
	git fetch
	git merge master origin/master
